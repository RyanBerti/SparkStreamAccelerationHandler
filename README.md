This repo contains the Spark streaming application that was developed for the December 2015 Teradata IoT Hackathon. The goal of the application was to process incoming accelerometer data from sets of mobile devices associated with 'zones', and signal that a certain zone was shaking when a majority of the devices in the zone were shaking. I worked with one other person (Andriy Rosa) on the setup of the Spark/Kafka cluster, and the development of the Spark streaming application code. A third person (Sara Jarjoura) worked on developing a web application and associated webserver to read and send accelerometer to the Spark/Kafka cluster. We were able to demo the application successfully, and enjoyed many coffees and snacks along the way.
